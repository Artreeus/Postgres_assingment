-- PostgreSQL Bookstore Database Assignment

-- Database Setup
-- Create a new database named "bookstore_db"
-- This command should be run in psql or another PostgreSQL client
-- CREATE DATABASE bookstore_db;

-- Connect to the database
-- \c bookstore_db

-- Table Creation
-- 1. Create books table
CREATE TABLE books (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (price >= 0) NOT NULL,
    stock INTEGER NOT NULL,
    published_year INTEGER NOT NULL
);

-- 2. Create customers table
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    joined_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
);

-- 3. Create orders table
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers(id),
    book_id INTEGER REFERENCES books(id),
    quantity INTEGER CHECK (quantity > 0) NOT NULL,
    order_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Sample Data Insertion
-- 1. Insert sample data into the books table
INSERT INTO books (id, title, author, price, stock, published_year) VALUES
(1, 'The Pragmatic Programmer', 'Andrew Hunt', 40.00, 10, 1999),
(2, 'Clean Code', 'Robert C. Martin', 35.00, 5, 2008),
(3, 'You Don''t Know JS', 'Kyle Simpson', 30.00, 8, 2014),
(4, 'Refactoring', 'Martin Fowler', 50.00, 3, 1999),
(5, 'Database Design Principles', 'Jane Smith', 20.00, 0, 2018);

-- 2. Insert sample data into the customers table
INSERT INTO customers (id, name, email, joined_date) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 'alice@email.com', '2023-01-10'),
(2, 'Bob', 'bob@email.com', '2022-05-15'),
(3, 'Charlie', 'charlie@email.com', '2023-06-20');

-- 3. Insert sample data into the orders table
INSERT INTO orders (id, customer_id, book_id, quantity, order_date) VALUES
(1, 1, 2, 1, '2024-03-10'),
(2, 2, 1, 1, '2024-02-20'),
(3, 1, 3, 2, '2024-03-05');

-- PostgreSQL Problems & Solutions

-- 1. Find books that are out of stock
-- This query selects books with zero stock
SELECT title 
FROM books 
WHERE stock = 0;

-- 2. Retrieve the most expensive book in the store
-- This query finds the book with the highest price
SELECT * 
FROM books 
WHERE price = (SELECT MAX(price) FROM books);

-- 3. Find the total number of orders placed by each customer
-- This query counts orders grouped by customer name
SELECT c.name, COUNT(o.id) AS total_orders
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.name;

-- 4. Calculate the total revenue generated from book sales
-- This query calculates the sum of (book price Ã— quantity) for all orders
SELECT SUM(b.price * o.quantity) AS total_revenue
FROM orders o
JOIN books b ON o.book_id = b.id;

-- 5. List all customers who have placed more than one order
-- This query finds customers with multiple orders
SELECT c.name, COUNT(o.id) AS orders_count
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.name
HAVING COUNT(o.id) > 1;

-- 6. Find the average price of books in the store
-- This query calculates the average price across all books
SELECT AVG(price) AS avg_book_price
FROM books;

-- 7. Increase the price of all books published before 2000 by 10%
-- This query updates the price of books published before 2000
UPDATE books
SET price = price * 1.1
WHERE published_year < 2000;

-- Display updated book prices after the update
SELECT * FROM books;

-- 8. Delete customers who haven't placed any orders
-- This query removes customers with no associated orders
DELETE FROM customers
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT customer_id FROM orders);

-- Display remaining customers after the deletion
SELECT * FROM customers;
